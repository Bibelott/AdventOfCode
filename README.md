# Bibelott's Advent Of Code Solutions

My solutions to the [Advent Of Code](adventofcode.com) events, organized by year. 

Every day's solution is completely self-contained. 
There's no _utils_ library to obfuscate what's actually going on and
no external code is used except for the given language's std library [^*].

Every year I use a different language, so far I've done:

| Year | Language | 
|------| --------:|
| 2023 | [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) |
| 2024 | [Zig](https://ziglang.org) |
| 2025 | [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) |

I'm currently in the process of adding the 2023 and 2024 solutions, 
as I didn't think about creating this repo until 2025. 
That's why the commit history is weird.

[^*]: Sometimes I include some extra solutions, where I just mess around with some stupid idea I had. 
I might use external libraries in those, like in [2025 Day 5](../blob/master/2025/d4/p1_cuda)
